21 Nov 2003: Version 0.5
Applied patch from Peter Peres (plp@actcom.co.il).  Adds "-l" command-line
argument to output in list format.  Includes decoded ASCII characters from
DB directives as comments.  Nice feature, thanks Peter!

3 Nov 2003: Version 0.4
The same code as version 0.3, but things are packaged a little more neatly
into the tarball and documentation has been updated to reflect the version
change.  Also, this time I remembered to add a link from my Dis51 page to
the tarball.

15 Feb 2003: Version 0.3
Updated to work with new libhexfile.  This version was "released" in that it
was placed on a publically available website, but I failed to add a public
link to it.  So this version, if you have it, is a collector's item.

7 Dec 2002: Version 0.2
This is the first numbered version.  Any unnumbered version is 0.1.  I don't
know if I released the program multiple times, so there may be different
0.1 versions out there.  The only difference in 0.2 is the new libhexfile
library, which really shouldn't affect the program since 32-bit addresses
are not used in any 8051 variant I've heard of.
